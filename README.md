This is a little repository to show a problem with the kirby3 static site generator. 

# The Problem #
The problem is that I have a site with two languages, german and english. When I start kirby local all pages are fine. The translation is good, but if I start the static site generator, the html-file are not consistence.
The translation through the language/de.php or language/en.php show correct, but the content the page get through the panel does not show correct.
